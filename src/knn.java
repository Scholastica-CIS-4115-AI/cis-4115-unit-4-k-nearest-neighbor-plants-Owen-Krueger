 * The knn class implements the nearest neighbor algorithm to classify if a new test plant is a tree or a bush
 *     Data is read in that is already classified as trees or bushes.
 *     The height and circumference of the new plant is entered
 *     This data is compared to each of the known plants
 *     It is classified based on which known plant is nearest the new plant.
